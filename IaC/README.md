# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Setup the infrastructure for AVOps using Terraform scripts. Each resource/service is setup with a respective Terraform module in the `./modules` directory. The main calling Terraform script can be found at `./root/main.tf`. 

To get started setting up the infrastructure, refer to setup [guide](./root/README.md).
