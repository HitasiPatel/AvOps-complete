# Setup Infrastructure using Terraform

Setup the infrastructure for AVOps using Terraform scripts. Each resource/service is setup with a respective Terraform module in the `./modules` directory. The main calling Terraform script can be found at `./root/main.tf`. 

To get started by using Terraform to deploy the infrastructure, refer to the [setup guide](./root/README.md).
